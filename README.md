# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

This weather application was created for travelers. Those who travel wouldn like to see the weather of where they are traveling to so that they may bring the appropriate clothing.
This weather app allows the user to search any city in the world and will proved them with 
the current and upcoming five day forecasted weather. The app also saves the user's searches so that they may easily get back to it and view the forecast. 

Through building this application, I have learned how to use server side APIs and implement them with JavaScript to create a dynamic weather application.
